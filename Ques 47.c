/* This program prompts the user to enter an integer between 1 and 20,
   reads in the integer value, and then uses a nested for loop to 
   output a square pattern of '@' characters on the screen, with the
   number of rows and columns of the square equal to the value of the 
   integer entered by the user. The '@' character is output in the
   diagonal elements of the square, and spaces are output for all other elements.
   The output is formatted so that each row of the square is printed on a separate line. */
