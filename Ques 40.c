// a)
/* STEP 1: Obtain three numbers from the keyboard
   STEP 2: Multiply the three numbers together and store the result in a variable called product
   STEP 3: Display the result to the user */
   
// b)
/* STEP 1: Obtain two numbers from the keyboard
   STEP 2: If the first number is smaller than the second number, display "The first number is smaller"
   STEP 3: If the second number is smaller than the first number, display "The second number is smaller"
   STEP 4: If the two numbers are equal, display "The numbers are equal" */
   
// c)
/* STEP 1: Initialize a variable called sum to 0
   STEP 2: Initialize a variable called count to 0
   STEP 3: Repeat the following steps until the user enters -1:
           a. Obtain a positive number from the keyboard
           b. If the number is positive, add it to the sum and increment the count
           c. If the number is not positive, ignore it
  STEP 4:  If count is greater than 0, compute the average by dividing sum by count and display the result
  STEP 5: If count is 0, display "No positive numbers were entered" */
