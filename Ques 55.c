/* The given program segment prints a pattern of numbers in a triangle shape.

The variable n is initialized to 4 and a is initialized to 1.

The outer for loop with the index variable i runs from 1 to 4.

In each iteration of the outer loop, 
the inner for loop with the index variable c runs from 1 to the current value of i.

In each iteration of the inner loop, the value of a is printed, then incremented by 1.

After the inner loop completes, a new line is printed using the printf function with the newline character \n.

The output of the program segment looks like the following:

1
23
456
78910 */
